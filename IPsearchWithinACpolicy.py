File: IPsearchWithinACpolicy.py 

Usage: is a python script that makes use of the requests
    module to search within an Access Control Policy for a specified IP.

    ./IPsearchWithinACpolicy.py [-h] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [-f FMC] [-i SEARCH] [-e] [-c]
    python3 ./IPsearchWithinACpolicy.py [-h] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [-f FMC] [-i SEARCH] [-e] [-c]

Inputs: 
    username,
    password,
    IP address of FMC,
    IP address you are looking for,
    whether to compact the output,
    whether to expand the output

Outputs:
    Name of the Access Control Policy and Rule that contains the IP address (if it exists)
